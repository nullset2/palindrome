# palindrome
A program that reads a string from stdin, computes whether the string is a palindrome or not, and outputs a concluision. Done for Icalia Labs, 2015.

EXPLANATION

Take the string received and, since we don't care about its formatting, only whether it's a palindrome or not when you actually *read the string vocally*, make it all lowercase, remove the spaces, and remove non-alphanumeric characters.

Then, take that string and compare it to the same string reversed. Is it the same? If it is, output true, else, output false.
